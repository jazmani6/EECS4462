This was an Arpeggiator which was created through the JUCE Framework in C++ to implement musical arpeggiation of MIDI Chords, and output them through an audio output.

There are 4 main types of Arpeggiation of notes, which I will go into detail on below:

1. Ascending, which means that notes inputted on a keyboard will be played in ascending order, ex. for notes E4, G4, and C4, notes will be played in the order C4, E4, G4
2. Descending, which means that notes inputted on a keyboard will be played in descending order, ex. for notes E4, G4, and C4, notes will be played in the order G4, E4, C4
3. Sweeping, which means that notes inputted on a keyboard will be played in ascending and then descending order, ex. for notes E4, G4, and C4, notes will be played in the order
C4, E4, G4, G4, E4, C4
4. Outside to Inside, which means notes inputted on a keyboard will be played Outwards to inwards, for notes C5, D5, E5,F5, the notes will be ordered C5, F5, D5, E5.

Additional functionality includes setting arpeggiation for up to 3 octaves, so for instance, if C3, D3 is the input, and 2 is the number of octaves increased, 
the output will be C3, D3, C4, D4, C5, D5 since there are two additional octaves.

In addition, I implemented a few different speed combinations for certain notes which allows the user to halve or double the duration of the first and last notes in combination
with each other, which creates for more variety in arpeggiation.
